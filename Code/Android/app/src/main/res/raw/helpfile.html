<h1>Nonograms - Help</h1> <br>
<h2>What is a nonogram?</h2> <br>

A nonogram is tile-based puzzle solved by using the provided numeric clues for the rows and columns of the game grid.  
Tiles are selected so that they conform to the clues for their particular column and row.  
Clues may represent a single tile or groups of adjacent tiles in that row or column.  
Multiple clues in a row or column represent a division of groups by at least one empty tile.  <br><br>

<h5><i>An example of puzzle clues.  In the second column there is a group of three tiles, and two groups of two tiles.  Each of these 
groups must be separated by at least one empty cell.</i></h5></div><br>

<h2>How to play?</h2> <br>
In the main menu, a new game is started by choosing the difficulty level from the drop down and pressing play.  <br><br>

<h5><i>Select difficulty and press play.</i></h5></div><br>
A new puzzle will open.  At the start of a new puzzle, all tiles are empty (white) by default.  <br><br>

<h5><i>Empty game grid.</i></h5></div><br><br>
Empty tiles are filled (black) by simply clicking on the tile.  
A previously filled tile can be cleared by simply clicking on it again.  
A puzzle is solved when the game grid matches all of the numeric clues provided above 
each row and to the side of each column.  <br><br>
